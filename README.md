# Cloud & DevOps Engineer:

### About Me

Hi! I'm always open to learning and sharing knowledge with others. As someone who loves working with Python and PowerShell, I spend a lot of time exploring machine learning, AI, and AWS technologies.

I enjoy both working independently and as part of a team, especially when it comes to managing projects and keeping documentation up to date. I've worked on some interesting projects involving Containers, Microservices, and Oracle Cloud, and I've built up a good understanding of AWS services along the way.

Right now, I'm expanding my knowledge through Great Lakes' PG program in cloud computing. It's giving me hands-on experience with multi-cloud environments including AWS, Azure, and GCP.

#####Areas of Interest:
